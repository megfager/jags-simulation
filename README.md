# Bifactor Item Response Models with Within-Item Interaction Effects

This repository contains files and information related to my dissertation simulation study. It includes files I used to generate data for bifactor item response models having within-item interaction effects. The models were the 2-parameter normal ogive model for 2-category data and the graded response model for K-category data. 

My dissertation is contained within the dissertation folder of this repository.
